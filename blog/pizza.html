<h2> <span style=color:#d45dc3>pizza tower is fucking epic (spoilers ahead)</span></h2>
<div class="blogpilled">
so theres this game called pizza tower, it released on january 26th of this year and was made by tour de pizza. (im pretty sure theyre like, only a couple people?? mcpig and sertif methinks?) anyway, its probably my game of the year already???? i know thats fucking silly to say in february, but jesus christ i cant get enough!!!
<p> 
you play as peppino spaghetti, and u gotta climb the pizza tower to stop the evil pizzaface who is gonna blow up ur restaurant with a big evil laser!!!! fucked up right?? peppino has an insane moveset that is initially super duper overwhleming.. over the game though it starts to feel like second nature!! sprinting through these expertly designed levels like youre some sort of butterguy!!!! (guy made outta butter) in the levels you gotta find the 5 toppins, 3 secrets, AND the secret treasure! well you dont HAVE to, the most youll have to do is get most of the toppins if you wanna beat the game. but <em><ins>I</em></ins> like to get everything in the levels LOL!! you get a grade depending on how many points u got, which is heavily weighed by the collectables you got and your combos i think! oh yeah, when u kill an enemy you start a combo! you can add to it by killing more, but itll go away after a few seconds if you dont do that in time... you can also collect things to refresh the combo timer! (this will be important, remember this xO !) once u make it to the end of a level you knock over john pillar, a big pillar, triggering PIZZA TIME!!!!!! during pizza time, a timer starts counting down. you gotta haul ass back to the start of the level!! this also switches all the active/inactive john blocks, changing your path on the way back!!! pizza time goes fucking crazy, and if youre insane enough you can even go for a LAP 2 and have to do the WHOLE ESCAPE AGAIN!!! and ONLY with the remaining time u had left from the first lap.... XOOO theres also a few boss fights, and theyre all fucking great too! but enough about the gameplay, i wanna talk about how great this game looks and sounds!
<p> 
im a huge cartoon fan obviously, and this game is clearly inspired by the 90s and early 2000s style of gross out cartoons! but like, obviously a bit different, as everthing has a mspaint-esce 1 pixel outline! its a style i like a whole lot hehe xP PLUS it has wacky silly sound effects that make everything feel super silly and slapstick-esce!!
<p>
and thats not even to MENTION the soundtrack????? dude, honestly in my top two indie ost of all fuckin time!!!! constant banger after banger, but probably my personal favorite is unexpectancy part two. it has these vocal samples from a 1920s song, and they scratch my lil brain in a way i was NOT ready for hahahaha

i gotta say, though. the thing that hooked me the most with this game was getting the best rank on every level, the coveted "P Rank." to get one, you need to go through the whole level collecting all 5 toppins, all 3 secrets, and get the secret treasure while also keeping a single combo going the WHOLE LEVEL!!! plus, you need enough points over all to get an S rank. then, during the escape, you NEED to do a LAP 2!!!!! WHILE STILL KEEPING THE SAME COMBO!!!!! luckily, all 5 toppins, the secret treasure, and ANY little toppings or clocks u collect refresh the combo countdown!! smaller ones refresh it a little less than big things, so keep that in mind!!! it is really really hard, and also really gratifying to get right. any mistake, and youre for sure hittin that restart button unless ur able to supertaunt to recover or something LAWL
<p>
ive been going through trying to get all of em, and i have 4 levels left! so im pretty close hehe. oh, you can also p rank bosses by beating them without taking damage. i did those, and they went fine except for the final boss. that was a bit annoying, but its doable!!! speaking of, the final boss was super swag!! it rounded out the game perfectly!!!
<p>
i cant do this game enough justice with my shitty vocabulary, you really gotta play it urself!!! its 20 dollars, which is a FUCKING STEAL!!! UR PRACTICALLY COMMITTING A CRIME WITH A PRICE THAT LOW!!! xD
