<div class="blogpilled">
woah uh, its been a sec! 
<p>
lots of stuff has happened, and by that i mean a couple of big things happened and then for the rest of the time i just made youtube videos and went to school (boooo!!!)
<p>
the biggest thing..........
<p><em><ins><span class="bigger">IM ENGAGED!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</ins></em></span>
<p>
me n my partner juno decided to exchange rings and become officially engaged, which makes me really happy! we don't have any plans re: wedding or anything yet, but the security of being fiancees is really nice :3
<p>
ummm... other than that... idk! im back into homestuck again, (thanks jason.) and ive been super into dungeon meshi! delicious in dungeon in english (horrid name) is really really fucking good and i encourage anyone reading this to read that instead because WAOWOWOOW its 97 chapters of swag awesome. i ESPECIALLY recommend if u like dnd a ton like i do.
<p>
but uuhhhh yeah! thats that! i mainly wanted to post this as an excuse to say im engaged, hehe.
<p>
