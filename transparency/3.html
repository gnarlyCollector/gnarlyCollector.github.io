		<p>Your name is JADE. You aren't 100% sure on how you ended up here, but calling this nothingness a "room" is surprisingly accurate? It's a bit hard to see, but the space you are in has defined walls. You can't really see them without squinting. 
		<br><br>
		You have a variety of INTERESTS, which all seem UNIMPORTANT given your current circumstances. You enjoy RHYTHM VIDEO GAMES, and you are a self proclaimed PRO at them. You have aspirations to be a VOICE ACTRESS, but that dream continues to feel more and more SCARY. You like to watch CARTOONS a whole lot, and you've actually been watching an episode of SPONGEBOB in your head the entire time you've been trapped in this room. Rewatching the same episode over and over as a stupid kid has its perks. You are also an AMATEUR ARTIST, who likes to dabble a bit in ANIMATION as well. 
		<br><br>Man, listing off the things you like probably wasn't great for your mental health while trapped in transparent background purgatory. Haha, nevermind, you just got to the part of the episode where Squidward gets run over by a rock. Classic.
