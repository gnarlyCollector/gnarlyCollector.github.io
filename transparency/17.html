		<p>Your SYLLADEX'S FETCH MODUS is currently dictated by the logic of a TRIE DATA STRUCTURE. No, it's not a TREE DATA STRUCTURE, it's completely different. You are tired of making this distinction.
<br>
It's great for reTRIEval, but the way it stores items into subcategories based on letter leads to the unique issue of MULTIPLES OF THE SAME CARD being REJECTED OUTRIGHT.
<br>
Though as shown by the rocks, this can be counteracted by simply combining the multiples into one card.
