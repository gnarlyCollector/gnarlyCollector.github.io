		<p>You open the NODES of your SYLLADEX that have CAPTCHALOGUED ITEMS inside. Conveniently for your POOR MEMORY, these are labeled in BLUE.
<br>
With you, in alphabetical order, you have: ONE (1) CHESS SET, TWO (2) GAME ENVELOPES [CURRENTLY WORTHLESS], ONE (1) GLASSES CASE, SEVERAL (~) MARBLES IN A BAG, FOUR (4) ROCKS, ONE (1) PAIR OF SCISSORS, and ONE (1) SKETCHBOOK [CURRENTLY WORTHLESS].
<br>
