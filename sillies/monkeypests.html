<h2> <span style=color:#d45dc3>monkey watch and packing pests are the same?</span></h2>
<div class="blogpilled">
so, you may already know this but im a big rhythm heaven fan LOL! i was at work and i was playing the soundtrack over the speakers (because im a little freak) and when the ost for packing pests was playing i realized i was absentmindedly using the "OOK II OO KI KI" sound effect from monkey watch when the do the double slap instead of the "double up" that normally occurs in packing pests. then i realized "holy shit the games are the same"<p>

	<div align="center">
	(here are the sound effects for reference):<p>
	<audio
        controls
        src="../sound/ookki.wav">
    </audio>
	<audio
        controls
        src="../sound/doubleup.wav">
    </audio>
	</div>	
when i got home from work i looked to see if anyone had done anything with this before, and sure enough! there was <a href="https://youtu.be/dvdJ1Pylatk" class="blog">a video by Jaydakin</a> that put monkey watchs sound effects over the packing pests song!! its really silly!!<p>(you should check it out by clicking the funny link text up there)
<p>
i decided to do the same but with the monkey watch song and the packing pests sound effects! here it is in all its glory!!!
	<div align="center">
	<audio
		controls
		src="../sound/monkey-pests.wav">
	</audio>
	</div>
	for the first few bars, i decided to keep both games sounds playing to further illsutrate how similar they are haha! anyway, yeah, i know they arent exactly the same since in packing pests you hit a AND b a lot on certain beats but blah blah blah it is still fundamentally the same! which is pretty cool i think hehe x)
